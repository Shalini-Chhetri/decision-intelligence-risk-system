# Decision Intelligence Risk System

## Project Overview
Decision Intelligence Risk System is an end-to-end analytics project that demonstrates how raw financial data can be transformed into structured insights to support real-world risk decisions. The project integrates database design, analytical modeling, visualization, and an AI-based explanation layer to reflect how decision intelligence systems are used in practice.

The focus of this project is not automated decision-making, but supporting informed, human-led decisions through transparent and interpretable analytics.

## Problem Context
Organizations that evaluate financial risk rely on large volumes of raw data, analytical models, and clear communication to make responsible decisions. This project simulates a real-world risk analytics workflow, illustrating how data is processed from ingestion and storage through analysis, interpretation, and decision support.

## Key Components
- **Database Design (SQL):** Structured schema for borrower, loan, and outcome data
- **Data Processing & Modeling (Python):** Data preparation, feature engineering, and predictive modeling
- **Statistical Validation (R & Stata):** Model interpretation, robustness checks, and statistical analysis
- **Data Visualization:** Dashboards to communicate portfolio trends and risk patterns
- **AI Explanation Layer:** Plain-language summaries and insights generated from analytical outputs
- **Business Outputs:** Reports and Excel-based tools to reflect real organizational use cases

## Data
- **Primary Dataset:** Lending Club loan-level data  
- **Documentation:** Official Lending Club data dictionary  

Raw data files are stored locally and excluded from version control.
